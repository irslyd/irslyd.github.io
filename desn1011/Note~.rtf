\f0\fs24 \cf0 I used the Opera browser in a 13-inch MacBook screen to build this site. I don\'92t think its responsive in other browser which causes it to be distorted when the site is running. Just letting you know just in case. Thank you so much for all the help and teaching us this semester, it is a really interesting field in design and I had fun (and also frustrated at times) even though its my first time touching any coding concepts or coding at all. Thank you again and I hope you have a wonderful time after this semester ends. Wishing all the best!}
